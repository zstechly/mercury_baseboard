# mercury_baseboard
Verilog top level + peripherals for micronova mercury FPGA board
Just a basic project to extend for future projects
I bought this board some time ago because the package was a dim and I could use it as a robot controller.
It functioned well, and was inexpensive.

The Spartan 3A FPGA is quite old however, and there are certainly better choices for a low-end FPGA now adays.  The purpose of the board then became "Can I use the free tier of Amazon AWS to compile an FPGA."  The free tier was limited to 1GB of ram, so my hopes weren't high...but it performed well on the 10-year old FPGA + no longer supported ISE WebPACK ISE
